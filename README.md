## 📖 Overview

**Iter Catholicum** is an all-in-one liturgical companion. It combines the technical precision of the `romcal` liturgical engine with a beautiful, antique-inspired interface to offer users a bridge between tradition and modern technology. Whether you are checking the rank of a festivity or reading the Vulgate for prayer, this tool is designed to be fast, reliable, and spiritually focused.

### Key Features

- **✨ Daily Liturgical Card**: Instant view of today's liturgical context directly on the home page.
- **📖 Public Domain Bible Reader**: Access to historical, copyright-free translations in both Spanish and Latin (Vulgata & Torres Amat).
- **🔠 Elegant Typography**: Traditional drop caps and refined font sets for an immersive reading experience.
- **🔍 Smart Search**: Instant, accent-insensitive search for festivities and biblical passages.
- **🌍 Bilingual Interface**: Effortless toggling between Latin (_lingua ecclesiastica_) and Spanish.
- **💎 Premium Design**: A curated "clerical" aesthetic with dark red accents, ivory paper textures, and elegant typography.
